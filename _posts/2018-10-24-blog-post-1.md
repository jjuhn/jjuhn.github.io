This is a review of Using Bayesian Aldrich-McKelvey Scaling to Study Citizens' Ideological Preferences and Perceptions by Christopher Hare et al. 

- Surveys like the American National Election Studies are good tools to know citizens' ideological preferences and perception. 
- Does citizens possess spatial awareness in politics?(do they fully understand their position relative to other political figures on important dimenstions of political competition?)
- This survey could actually obscure rather than illuminate the true nature of the political world. 
- DIF(differential item functioning) aka interpersonal incomparability arises when respondents interpret and answer survey items such as issue scales differently.  
  For example, two respondents with the same opinion may nonetheless place themselves at different position on the scale, or two respondents with different opinions may locate themselves at the same position
- Aldrich and McKelvey's solution to DIF is to treat raw placements as linear distortion of the true position of the stimuli.
- Stimuli in this study is political parties and candidates or their policy. 
- This AM method estimates each respondent's perceptual distortion parameters(intercept/shift and weight/stretch) and 
  recover underlying locations of the stimuli as well as the respondents on a common latent dimension from issue scale data.
